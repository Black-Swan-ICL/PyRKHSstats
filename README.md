# PyRKHSstats
A Python package implementing a variety of statistical/machine learning methods 
that rely on kernels (e.g. HSIC for independence testing).

## Implemented
- Independence testing with HSIC using the Gamma approximation, as introduced in
  'A Kernel Statistical Test of Independence', A. Gretton, K. Fukumizu, C. Hui 
  Teo, L. Song, B. Scholkopf, A. J. Smola (2007).
  
## In development
- Two-sample testing with MMD.
- Goodness-of-fit testing.
- Methods for time series models.
- Bayesian statistical kernel methods.
